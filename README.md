# The-World-Ends-With-You-Engine-Remake

I decided to remake the battle engine from scratch for the video game: The World Ends With You, as a little side project.

Its a little buggy and there isn't really much to do besides move around the map and shoot at nothing, because I decided not to code in any enemies, but overall I say its a big success!
